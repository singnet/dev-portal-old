## Introduction to AGIX Tokens
The AGIX Token is an ERC-20 token, which is hosted on the Ethereum Blockchain.

SingularityNET uses the AGIX Token for any paid calls to a service.

## Testnet AGIX vs Mainnet AGIX
If you are unfamiliar with  Ethereum, it might be hard to understand between Testnet and Mainnet tokens. 
However, to understand the different network tokens, you can follow principles listed below:
* Testnet tokens are used to test software applications with, try out demos, or in our case the Beta.
* Mainnet tokens are used for officially deployed software.
* Testnet tokens never have a monetary value.
* Mainnet tokens could have a monetary value.
* Both tokens can be used to add extra utility to the software.

We only use Kovan and Ropsten Testnet AGIX and the current beta stage. 

To learn more about  Mainnet AGIX Token (to be used in a later stage) refer to this link [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8eb24319393716668d768dcec29356ae9cffe285) with the address `0x8eb24319393716668d768dcec29356ae9cffe285`.
