## Running snet-daemon on Raspbbery Pi

As of version 0.1.9 we have begun [publishing ARM releases for the daemon](https://github.com/singnet/snet-daemon/releases).

This should work on Raspberry Pi 1 model B and up.

```
wget https://github.com/singnet/snet-daemon/releases/download/v0.1.9/snet-daemon-v0.1.9-linux-arm6.tar.gz
tar xfvz snet-daemon-v0.1.9-linux-arm6.tar.gz 

```
