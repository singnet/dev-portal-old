The platform's primary reason for existence is to allow a diverse collection AI services to be bought and sold via a distributed marketplace.
Anyone can publish the availability of their machine learning method, or integrated AI solution, and allow clients to interact with and pay for them
directly.
Groups are logical bucketing of managing payments ( same recipient for each group across all the services in an organization)
As part of Supporting a single [channel](/docs/products/AIMarketplace/coreconcepts/Smart-contracts/mpe) per Organization per Group (Payment Group across the services)
we will need all the services to share the same channel state,We need to standardize what this state is across all services belonging to the same group.
